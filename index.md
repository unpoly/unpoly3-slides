# About Unpoly

[Unpoly](https://unpoly.com) is an unobtrusive JavaScript framework for server-side web applications.\
It enables fast and flexible frontends while keeping rendering logic on the server.

**This presentation is for experienced Unpoly users\
who want to learn about the major changes in Unpoly 3.**



----

Unpoly 3 objectives
===================

<div class="row">
<div class="col" style="flex-grow: 1.5">

### Concurrency

- User clicking faster than the server can respond
- Multiple requests targeting the same fragment
- Forms where everything depends on everything else
- Responses arrive in different order than requests
- Multiple users working on the same backend data (stale caches)
- User losing connection while requests are in flight
- Lie-Fi (spotty Wi-Fi, EDGE, tunnel)
</div>
<div class="col">

### Quality of live improvements

- Optional targets
- More control over `[up-hungry]`
- Shorter data attributes
- More render callbacks
- Strict target derivation
- Better feedback
- Log separated by interactions
- Foreign overlays
</div>

# This will be a smooth update

- Upgrade from v2 to v3 will be *much* smoother than going from v1 to v2.
- Almost all are breaking changes are polyfilled by [`unpoly-migrate.js`](https://unpoly.com/changes/upgrading).
- Unpoly 3 keeps aliases for deprecated APIs going back to 2016.\
  You can upgrade from v1 to v3 (without going through v2).

See the [upgrade guide](https://unpoly.com/changes/upgrading) for details.

# Concurrency


---

# Cache revalidation

Unpoly has always cached `GET` responses for a few minutes.\
This allowed for instant navigation between pages we visited earlier, but had some issues:

- Users were sometimes seeing stale content.\
  Because of this many projects configured cache expiry down to a few seconds.
- Every non-GET request cleared the entire cache.\
  This caused unnecessary cache misses after submitting a form.
  
Unpoly 3 fixes all of this with *cache revalidation*.

---


The cache in Unpoly 3 now follows a *stale-while-revalidate* pattern.
After rendering stale content from the cache, Unpoly automatically reloads the fragment.
This process is called *cache revalidation*.
  
In effect Unpoly always renders twice:

- A first render pass from the cache (which may be stale)
- A second render pass from the server (which is always fresh)

This has many benefits:

- This allows a very long cache eviction time,
  allowing instant navigation for 90 minutes.
- We no longer need to clear the cache after a form submission.
- Because we always revalidate cached content, the user always sees fresh content!


---
<!-- _class: no-watermark -->

<img src="images/cache.svg" height="100%">

---

### `up.network.config.cacheExpireAge`

- Defaults to 15 seconds (down from 5 minutes in Unpoly 2)
- When cached content exceeds this age we perform cache revalidation\
 (reload a rendered fragment)


### `up.network.config.cacheEvictAge`

- Defaults to 90 minutes (lower for low-memory devices)
- When cached content exceeds this age we delete it from the cache


---

Controlling when to revalidate
------------------------------

You may configure what responses to revalidate, e.g. to exclude certain paths.\
The default setting is:


```js
up.fragment.config.autoRevalidate = (response) => response.stale
```

You may also disable revalidation for an individual link:

```html
<a href="/path" up-follow up-revalidate="false">
```


---

## Revalidation happens after `up.render()` settles


```js
await up.render(..)
// Fragment is updated, but animation and revalidation may still be underway
```

```js
await up.render(..).finished
// Fragment is fully updated, transitioned and revalidated
```

---

Does this cause more requests?
------------------------------

**No**.

With revalidation your app will make as many requests as a plain web app.

With revalidation your app will make as many requests as an Unpoly 2 app with short cache expiry.

**Optionally** our server can implement *conditional GET* so reloading is effectively free for the server.


----

Conditional GET support
===============


-----

GET conditional on modification time 
------------------------------------

Browser requests a URL for the first time:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
```

Server responds with content and modification time (e.g. `#updated_at`):


```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 2000 13:11:22 GMT
...
```

When the browser reloads is echoes the earlier modification time:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 15 Nov 2000 13:11:22 GMT
```

The server checks modification time and may respond **without content**:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```


-----

GET conditional on content hash
-------------------------------

Browser requests a URL for the first time:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
```

Server responds with content and a hash over the underlying data:


```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "x234dff"
...
```

When the browser reloads is echoes the earlier hash:

```http
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: "x234dff"
```

The server checks data hash and may respond **without content**:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```


----

Modification time or content hash?
----------------------------------


Servers can use both `Last-Modified` and `ETag`, but `ETag` takes precedence.

It's easier to mix in additional data into an `ETag`, e.g. the ID of the logged in user or the currently deployed commit revision.


----

Unpoly 3 supports conditional GET when reloading
-------------------------------------------------

Unpoly remembers the `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers a fragment was delivered with:

```html
<div class='messages' up-time='Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT' etag='"x234dff"'>
...
</div>
```

When the fragment is reloaded:

```http
GET /messages HTTP/1.1
X-Up-Target: .messages
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
If-None-Match: "x234dff"
```

If no fresher data exists, the server may skip rendering and respond with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

In practice you would use either `Last-Modified` or `ETag`, but never both.




----

Your app should probably support conditional GET
------------------------------------------------

This improves **all** cases where we access a previously visited page:

- Speed up page loads without Unpoly
- Less server load for cache revalidation.
- Less server load for [`[up-poll]`](https://unpoly.com/up-poll)
- Prevent unncessary re-rendering of identical content.


----
<!-- _class: rails-specific -->


Implementing conditional GET in Ruby on Rails
=============================================

**If you're not a Rails user**, skip to a slide without the Rails logo â†—.


----
<!-- _class: rails-specific -->
```ruby
class PostsController < AppplicationController

  # Produce different ETags for different users
  etagger { current_user&.id }

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])

    # Produces ETag from (1) class name (2) @post.id
    # (3) @post.updated_at (4) view template code (5) flashes.
    # Renders 304 Not Modified if ETag matches If-None-Match header.
    fresh_when @post
  end
  
  def index
    @posts = Post.order(created_at: :desc)

    # Produces ETag from (1) class name (2) scope conditions
    # (3) @posts.maximum(:updated_at) (4) view template code (5) flashes.
    # Renders 304 Not Modified if ETag matches If-None-Match header.
    fresh_when @posts
  end

end
```




----
<!-- _class: rails-specific -->



Default ETags in Rails
----------------------

Even without `fresh_when` Rails produces a default ETag by hashing the response body.\
You still pay the rendering time, but won't transmit unchanged HTML.

This default ETag has issues with random tokens (CSRF token, CSP nonce).\
Use [`Rack::SteadyETag`](https://github.com/makandra/rack-steady_etag) to address this.



----


All of this is optional!
------------------------

Cache revalidation will work **with or without** conditional GET support.

If your app does not support conditional GET, cache revalidation will cause as many requests as an Unpoly 2 app with short cache expiry.


----
<!-- _class: no-watermark -->

Concurrent updates to the same fragment
=======================================

<div class="row">
<div class="col" style="flex-basis: auto">
<img src="images/layout-side-main.svg" style="height: 150px; margin: 0;">
</div>
<div class="col" style="flex-basis: auto">

When two requests target `main`, what should happen?
</div>
</div>


### Unpoly 1: Do nothing

Responses would be rendered in whatever order they arrive.

### Unpoly 2: Abort all other requests when navigating

The last request would be the one rendered.\
This also aborted background requests, or requests for unrelated regions like `side`.

### Unpoly 3: Abort requests within the targeted fragment only



---


Aborting requests targeting a fragment
--------------------------------------

Clicking this link will automatically cancel requests targeting `.region` or its descendants:
    
```html
<a href="/path" up-target=".region">
```

Same when rendering programmatically:

```js
up.render({ url: '/path', target: '.region' })
```

Aborting without rendering:

```js
up.fragment.abort('.region')
```


---

Reacting to a fragment being aborted
-----------------------------------

Use `up.fragment.onAborted(fragment, callback)` to react when fragment or its ancestor is aborted on its layer.

A fragment is also aborted before it is removed from the DOM (through `up.destroy()` or a fragment update).


---
<!-- _class: no-watermark -->


This compiler will follow a link after 5 seconds:

```js
up.compiler('a[auto-follow]', function(link) {
  let timer = setTimeout(() => up.follow(link), 5000)
  return () => clearTimeout(timer)
})
```

We now have a race condition:

- Timer starts
- User follows different link (1)
- While the user link is loading, the timer elapses and follows the original link
- The user request (1) is aborted

Using `up.fragment.onAborted()` we can stop the timer if the link is targeted while waiting:

```js
up.compiler('a[auto-follow]', function(link) {
  let timer = setTimeout(() => up.follow(link), 5000)
  up.fragment.onAborted(link, () => clearTimeout(timer))
})
```


----

More use cases for `up.fragment.onAborted()` from Unpoly's own features:

- Polling stops when the fragment is aborted
- Pending validations are aborted when the observed field is aborted


---

Exemption: Don't abort others
------------------

To not abort requests targeting the same fragments,\
render with `{ abort: false }` or `[up-abort=false]`.



Exemption: Don't abort me
--------------

To make a request that will not be aborted by another fragment update, use `{ abortable: false }` or `[up-abortable=false]`.


Preloading
----------

Preloading never aborts targeted fragments.

Programmatic preloading with `up.link.preload()` is not abortable by default.\
You can use this to populate the cache while the user is navigating.



---
<!-- _class: no-watermark -->


Forms where everything depends on everything
======================================



```html
<form method="post" action="/purchases">
  <select name="continent" up-validate="[name=country]">...</select>
  <select name="country" up-validate="[name=price]">...</select>
  <input name="weight" up-validate="[name=price]"> kg
  <output name="price">23 â‚¬</output>
  <button>Buy stamps</button>
</form>
```

This form has race conditions in Upoly 2:

- User changes continent
- Request targeting `[name=country]` starts
- User changes weight
- Request targeting `[name=price]` starts
- User changes continent again
- Request targeting `[name=country]` starts
- Responses arrive and render in random order


---

Disabling form elements while loading
--------------------------------------

Forms with `[up-disable]` attribute disable all fields and buttons while submitting or validating.\
This prevents user input while the form is loading:


```html
<form up-submit up-disable>
  <input type="text" name="email"> <!-- will be disabled during submission -->
  <button>Submit</button>          <!-- will be disabled during submission -->
</form>
```

You can also only disable the submit button:

```html
<form up-submit up-disable="button">
```

Or any given CSS selector:

```html
<form up-submit up-disable="input[name=email]">
```


----

Concurrent `[up-validate]`: Consistency without disabling
--------------------------------------------------------

- Sometimes we don't want to disable because of user speed or optics (gray fields)
- Unpoly 3 has an alternative solution for forms with many `[up-validate]` dependencies
- Multiple `[up-validate]` targets are batched into a single render pass with multiple targets
- Duplicate or nested targets are merged
- Only one concurrent request.\
  Additional validations are queued until the current validation request has loaded.
- Form will eventually show a consistent state, regardless how fast the user clicks or how slow the network is.


----
<!-- _class: no-watermark -->


```html
<form method="post" action="/purchases">
  <select name="continent" up-validate="[name=country]">...</select>
  <select name="country" up-validate="[name=price]">...</select>
  <input name="weight" up-validate="[name=price]"> kg
  <output name="price">23 â‚¬</output>
  <button>Buy stamps</button>
</form>
```

<div class="row" style="font-size: 0.9em">
<div class="col">

### Unpoly 2

- User changes continent
- Request for `[name=country]` starts
- User changes weight
- Request for `[name=price]` starts
- User changes continent again
- Request for `[name=country]` starts
- Responses arrive and render in random order
</div>
<div class="col" style="flex-grow: 1.2">

### Unpoly 3

- User changes continent
- Request for `[name=country]` starts
- User changes weight
- User changes continent again
- Response for `[name=country]` received and rendered
- Request for `[name=price], [name=country]` starts
- Response for `[name=price], [name=country]` received and rendered
</div>
</div>


----


Watch rework
============

`[up-observe]` is now `[up-watch]`\
`up.observe()` is now `up.watch()`

They gain more options.

---

Field-specific watch options
----------------------------

Every form field can configure individual options for watching and validation.\
Options can be set for a field, the entire form or any container element.

#### `[up-watch-event]`

Which event triggers watch callbacks or validation (e.g. `input` or `change`).

#### `[up-watch-delay]`

How many milliseconds to wait after a change before a watch callback or validation is run.

#### `[up-watch-disable]`

Whether to disable this form (or any fragment) while an async watch callback or validation is running.

#### `[up-watch-feedback]`

Whether to set `.up-active` and `.up-loading` classes while an async watch callback or validation is running.

---

Example
-------

```html
<form method="post" action="/purchases">
  <select name="continent" up-validate="[name=country]" up-watch-disable="[name=country]">...</select>
  <select name="country" up-validate="[name=price]">...</select>
  <input name="weight" up-validate="[name=price]" up-watch-event="input"> kg
  <output name="price">23 â‚¬</output>
  <button>Buy stamps</button>
</form>
```

The `[up-watch-disable]` attribute disables the country select while new countries are loading after a continent changes.

The `[up-watch-event]` attribute updates the price while the user is typing in the weight field (instead of waiting until the field is blurred).



---

Handling disconnects
====================

Unpoly 3 lets you handle connection loss with an `{ onOffline }` or `[up-on-offline]` callback:

```html
<a href="..." up-on-offline="if (confirm('Retry'?) event.retry()">Post bid</a>
```

Or globally:

```js
up.on('up:fragment:offline', (event) => if (confirm('Retry'?)) event.retry())
```


----

Handling "Lie-Fi"
-----------------

Often our device reports a connection, but we're effectively offline:

- Smartphone in EDGE cell
- Car drives into tunnel
- Overcrowded Wi-fi with massive packet loss

Unpoly 3 handles Wi-Fi with timeouts:

- All requests have a default timeout of 90 seconds (`up.network.config.timeout`)
- Customize timeouts per-request with `{ timeout }`, `[up-timeout]` options
- Timeouts will now trigger `onOffline()` (used to by `onAborted()`)


----

Expired pages remain accessible while offline
---------------------------------------------

- Cached content will remain navigatable for 90 minutes
- Revalidation will fail
- Clicking uncached content will not change the page and trigger `onOffline()`


---


Limitations: This isn't full offline support (yet)
--------------------------------------------------

- The cache is still in-memory and dies with the browser tab
- To fill up the cache the device must be online for the first part of the session
- For a full offline experience (content with empty cache) we recommend a [service worker](https://web.dev/offline-fallback-page/) or a canned solution like [UpUp](https://www.talater.com/upup/) (similarities in name are coincidental)




---
<!-- _class: topic -->

# Quality of life


----


Optional targets
================

The following would require fragments matching `.content` and `.navigation`.

The fragment `.flashes` will only be updated if there is a match in both the current page and server response (like `[up-hungry]`).

```html
<a href="/post" up-target=".content, .flashes:maybe, .navigation">
```

----


More control over `[up-hungry]`
===============================

Elements with an `[up-hungry]` attribute are updated whenever the server sends a matching element, even if the element isn't targeted.

Unpoly 3 lets you control which layer and which target to piggy-back on.


---

Controlling which layer to piggy-back on
----------------------------------------

By default Unpoly only considers `[up-hungry]` fragments in the updating layer.

With `[up-if-layer=any]` a hungry fragment will be considered for updates in *any* layer.

A use case is notification elements in the application layout:

```html
<div class="flashes" up-if-layer="any">...</div>
<div class="unread-messages" up-if-layer="any">...</div>
```


---

Controlling which targets to piggy-back on
------------------------------------------

By default Unpoly considers `[up-hungry]` fragments for any update in its layer.

With `[up-if-target]` you can restrict which updates a hungry fragment will piggy-back on.

A use case is a canonical `<link>` element that should only update when we update a [main element](https://unpoly.com/main),
but not when we update smaller fragments:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="..." up-if-target=":main" />
```

----


Shorter data attributes
=======================


Unpoly always had [`[up-data]`](https://unpoly.com/up-data) to attach structured data to an element.

This is verbose when we're attaching simple key/value pairs:

```html
<div class="user" up-data="<%= { name: @user.name }.to_json %>">
```

It would feel more natural to use HTML5 data attributes instead:

```html
<div class="user" data-name="<%= @user.name %>">
```


---

In Unpoly 3 Simple data key/values can be attached with both `[up-data]` and HTML5 data attributes.

These three elements produce the same compiler data:

```html
<div up-data='{ "foo": "one", "bar": "two" }'></div>
<div data-foo='one' data-bar='two'></div>
<div up-data='{ "foo": "one" }' data-bar='bar'></div>
```

```js
up.compiler('div', function(element, data) {
  console.log(data.foo) // is always "one"
  console.log(data.bar) // is always "two"
})
```

Note that HTML5 data attributes are always strings.



---

Highlighting the targeted fragment
==================================

Targeted fragments get an `.up-loading` class.\
This lets you highlight the part of the screen that's loading.

Targeted fragments also get an [`[aria-busy]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-busy) attribute.

---

Example
-------

A link targeting a fragment:

```html
<a href="/path" up-target=".target">
<div class="target">old text</div>
```

While the request is loading:

```html
<a href="/path" up-target=".target" up-active>
<div class="target" class="up-loading" aria-busy>old text</div>
```

Once the fragment is updated all classes and attributes are removed:

```html
<a href="/path" up-target=".target">
<div class="target">new text</div>
```

---

Log separated by interactions
=============================

The log has a lot of debug information. It's often hard to find where the relevant output begins and ends.

The new log shows which user interaction triggered an event chain.

---

<!-- _class: no-watermark no-padding -->

<img src="./images/log-interaction-event.png" alt="New log" class="picture" style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">

---

Playing nice with foreign overlays
=================================

Unpoly 2 sometimes clashes with overlays from other libraries ("foreign overlay") like Bootstrap or TinyMCE:

- Clicking a foreign overlay closes an Unpoly overlay
- Unpoly steals focus from a foreign overlay

This happens when foreign overlays look "on top" visually (`z-index: 99999999999`), but their elements attach to the `<body>`. For Unpoly this looks like content on the root layer. 

This could often be fixed by attaching the foreign overlay to the correct Unpoly layer (pseudo-code):

```js
OtherOverlay.open({ content: 'foo', onOpen(overlay) { up.layer.element.attach(overlay) }})
```

However, the solution is custom to every library.

---

Making Unpoly aware of foreign overlays
----------------------------------------

You can push a selector into `up.layer.config.foreignOverlaySelectors` and Unpoly will no longer have layer-related opinions over that region. You no longer need to re-attach the foreign overlay element.

Example from `unpoly-bootstrap5.js`:

```js
up.layer.config.foreignOverlaySelectors.push(
'.modal',
'.popover',
'.dropdown-menu'
)
```


---

More control over the progress bar
==================================

Unpoly 2 shows a progress bar when any request takes too long to load.

This may be unwanted for requests are loading in the background, or have longer load
times in the best of cases (e.g. a large report).

Unpoly 3 gives you more control over if and when the progress bar shows.


---


Background requests
--------------------

Pass { background: true } or [up-background] when rendering or making a request

Background requests never trigger the progress bar.\
Background requests are also deprioritized.

### Uses cases from Unpoly

- Polling requests are background requests automatically
- Preload requests are background requests automatically


---

Custom target response times
----------------------------

You can also set `[up-bad-response-time]` on an individual link:

```html
<a href="/huge-report" up-bad-response-time="10_000">Open report</a>
```


----

Extensive render callbacks
==========================

You may now pass callback functions to intervene at many points
in the rendering lifecycle.

```js
up.render({
  url: '/path',
  onLoaded(event)        { /* Content was loaded from cache or server */ },
  focus(fragment, opts)  { /* Set focus */ },
  scroll(fragment, opts) { /* Set scroll positions */ },
  onRendered(result)     { /* Fragment was updated */ },
  onFailRendered(result) { /* Fragment was updated from failed response */ },
  onRevalidated(result)  { /* Stale content was re-rendered */ },
  onFinished(result)     { /* All finished, including animation and revalidation */ }
  onOffline(event)       { /* Disconnection or timeout */ },
  onError(error)         { /* Any error */ }
})
```

---

Strict target derivation
========================


Unpoly often needs to *derive* a target selector from an element.\
Some features that do this are `[up-poll]`, `up.reload()`, `[up-hungry]`.

```js
up.reload(element) // Produces a target selector from the given element
```

To build the selector, Unpoly 2 uses the following element properties in decreasing
order of priority:

- The element's `[up-id]` attribute
- The element's `[id]` attribute
- The element's `[name]` attribute
- The element's `[class]` names, ignoring `up.fragment.config.badTargetClasses`.
- The element's tag name

This sometimes produces a weak selector that won't uniquely identify the element.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
<link rel="canonical" href="..." up-hungry> <!-- targets "link", matching the stylesheet -->
```


---

New target derivation patterns
------------------------------

Unpoly 3 lets you configure patterns to use for target derivation.\
The following patterns are configured by default:

```js
up.fragment.config.targetDerivers = [
  '[up-id]',      // [up-id="foo"]
  '[id]',         // #foo
  'html',         // html
  'head',         // head
  'body',         // body
  'main',         // main
  '[up-main]',    // [up-main="root"]
  'link[rel]',    // link[rel="canonical"]
  '*[name]',      // input[name="email"]
  'form[action]', // form[action="/users"]
  'a[href]',      // a[href="/users/"]
  '[class]',      // .foo (filtered by up.fragment.config.badTargetClasses)
]
```

Note that tag names are now only used for unique elements (like `<body>` or `<main>`).

You can also push a function if your deriver can't be expressed in a pattern string.


---

Derived target verification
---------------------------

- Unpoly 3 will verify if a derived targets will actually match the element.
- If another element is matched, an error is thrown.
- This may throw errors in existing apps with ambiguous selectors.\
  You probably want to fix these cases by setting an `[id]`, `[up-id]` or `[class]` attribute.


---

Detect failure when server sends incorrect HTTP status
======================================================

Unpoly can render different content for [failed responses](https://unpoly.com/server-errors).\
E.g. a successful form submission should the main element when successful.\
When there are validation errors we want to re-render the form instead.

For this to work Unpoly requires servers to signal failure with an HTTP error code.\
E.g. an invalid form should render with HTTP 400 (Bad Request).

Unfortunately misconfigured server endpoints will send HTTP 200 (OK) for failed responses.\
This is not always easy to fix, e.g. when screens are rendered by libraries outside your control.

---

Forcing failure
---------------

Listeners to `up:fragment:loaded` can now force a failure, even for responses that are `200 OK`.

```js
up.on('up:fragment:loaded', (event) => {
  if (event.response.headers['X-Authentication-Error']) {
    // Force Unpoly to use render options for failure
    event.renderOptions.fail = true
  }
})
```

You may also globally customize what Unpoly considers an error:

```js
up.network.config.fail = (response) => 
  (response.status < 200 || response.status > 299) && response.status !== 304
```


---

Focus restoration
=================

Focus is saved automatically and restored when using the back and forward button.

Saved state includes:

- Which element is focused.
- The cursor position within a focused input element.
- The selection range within a focused input element.
- The scroll position within a focused input element.

---

Explicit focus restoration
------------------------

- `<a href="/path" up-follow up-focus="restore">`
- up.render({ focus: 'restore' })
- up.viewport.restoreFocus()

Note that Unpoly already had `{ focus: 'keep' }` to preserve focus within
an updating fragment.

IE11 removal
============

Unpoly 3 will no longer boot on IE11 or [legacy Edge (EdgeHTML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdgeHTML).\
If you need to support Internet Explorer 11, use Unpoly 2.

This allowed us to delete a lot of internal code.


---

Functions with a native replacement have been moved to `unpoly-migrate.js`:

| Deprecated function | Native replacement |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `up.util.assign()` | `Object.assign()` |
| `up.util.values()` | `Object.values()` |
| `up.element.remove()` | `Element#remove()` |
| `up.element.matches()` | `Element#matches()` |
| `up.element.closest()` | `Element#closest()` |
| `up.element.replace()` | `Element#replaceWith()` |
| `up.element.all()` | `document.querySelectorAll()` |
| `up.element.toggleClass()` | `Element#classList.toggle()` |

### Strict target derivation

Disable with:

```js
up.fragment.config.verifyDerivedTarget = false
up.fragment.config.targetDerivers.push('*')
```

---

### Cache Revalidation

Disable with:

```js
up.fragment.config.autoRevalidate = false
up.network.config.cacheEvictAge = up.network.config.cacheExpireAge = 15 * 60 * 1000
```
